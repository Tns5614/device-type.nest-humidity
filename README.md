# Nest Humidity Device Type

This device type will allow SmartThings to set the humidity on a Nest Thermostat. This uses a hack to get around fact that 
the Nest API does not allow the setting of humidity. Note: this is technically against the Nest TOS. So use at your own risk.

This is a stripped down version based on the work of dianoga7@3dgo.net and bmmiller@gmail.com.

I use this in conjunction with Humidity Reset Schedule SmartApp from bmmiller@gmail.com.
